# AI-History-Tuter
An AI LLM agent which can help in teaching and comprehensive reseach for a history student.
Of course. Here is a comprehensive summary of the AI History Tutor project we built together. You can use this for a project report, a presentation, or a README file.

Project Summary: AI History Tutor
The objective of this project was to develop a sophisticated, multimodal AI History Tutor designed to provide a comprehensive and interactive learning experience for students of Indian history. The agent is built upon a specialized knowledge base derived from the complete NCERT history curriculum (Classes 6-12) and is enhanced with a suite of advanced tools and a dynamic user interface.

The final application is an intelligent AI Agent, not just a simple chatbot. It possesses a reasoning engine powered by Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model, which allows it to analyze user queries and select the most appropriate tool from its extensive toolbox to formulate an answer.

Key Features and Capabilities:

Multi-Source Knowledge: The agent can retrieve information from its core NCERT textbook database, perform live web searches using the Brave Search API, and access encyclopedic knowledge from Wikipedia.

Advanced Educational Tools: Beyond simple Q&A, the agent is equipped with over a dozen specialized "teacher-like" abilities, including generating quizzes, creating chronological timelines, writing biographies, comparing and contrasting historical periods, and explaining complex concepts with analogies.

Multimodal Vision Analysis: The application features a dedicated section where users can upload an image or a single-page PDF of a map. The AI uses its vision capabilities to analyze the visual data and answer questions about it.

Authentic Persona Role-Play: Users can select from various historical personas (e.g., "Harappan Trader," "Mauryan Official"). The agent then adopts the chosen persona, strictly adhering to its knowledge, perspective, and linguistic style, even expressing confusion at modern concepts to provide an immersive experience.

Persistent Conversational Memory: All chat conversations are automatically saved to a local file (chat_history.json). This allows a user to close the application and resume their conversation later, with the agent remembering the entire context of their previous interactions.

The entire system is deployed in a user-friendly web application built with Streamlit, providing a seamless and interactive interface for all of its advanced capabilities.
