      "The Harappan civilization's town planning included a carefully planned drainage system with roads and streets laid out in a grid pattern, intersecting at right angles.  Streets with drains were laid out first, and houses were built along them.  The settlements were planned and implemented accordingly, using standardized bricks with a ratio where length and breadth were four and twice the height respectively.  Most settlements had a smaller, higher western part (Citadel) and a larger, lower eastern section (Lower Town), although there were variations.  Larger cities were built according to precise plans and had wide streets often oriented to cardinal directions.  Many cities were surrounded by fortifications.\n"
